## Riverview High

<div class="c-compatibility">
	responsive
</div>

I designed and developed this marketing site for the 2012-2013 productions of
 *Riverview High: The Musical*. 

Originally a WordPress site, I'm currently in the process of converting it to a
static site generated with Jekyll, served on GitHub pages.

Technologies:

* WordPress
* Jekyll
* GitHub Pages
* Yeoman
* Grunt
* Sass/Compass
