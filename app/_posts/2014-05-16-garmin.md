As the front-end engineer on this project, I developed an off-canvas navigation,
creating an app-like experience on the mobile web.

Features:

* Off-canvas flyout navigation
* Increased touch responsiveness with [Google's Fast Button](https://developers.google.com/mobile/articles/fast_buttons) technique
* Smartphone optimization across several localizations
